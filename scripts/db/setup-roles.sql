-- Sets up the two roles this project uses instead of one shared
-- credential, so DDL (schema changes) and DML (application queries)
-- are handled by different roles with different privileges:
--
--   poi_migrator - owns the schema, runs Flyway migrations (DDL rights)
--   poi_app      - used by the Spring Boot app at runtime (DML rights only)
--
-- Run as the postgres superuser, e.g. on Fedora:
--   sudo -iu postgres psql -f scripts/db/setup-roles.sql
--
-- Passwords are read from environment variables so nothing sensitive
-- ends up in shell history or this file. Set them before running:
--   export POI_MIGRATOR_PASSWORD='...'
--   export POI_APP_PASSWORD='...'
-- (use the same values you put in your local .env, see .env.example)

-- poi_app only needs to connect and use the public schema - it does not
-- own anything here, so by default it has no privileges on the tables
-- poi_migrator creates (ownership does not imply privileges in Postgres).

GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO poi_app;

-- Grant DML on every table/sequence poi_migrator creates from now on,
-- automatically. Without this, each new Flyway migration would require
-- a manual GRANT before poi_app could use the new table.
