 * Raised by an outbound adapter when the technology supplying a port fails in a way the model has
 * no opinion about: the database refused the connection, the gateway timed out, the broker rejected
 * the publish. Unchecked, so no port declares it and no layer between the adapter and the boundary
 * names it.
 *
 * <p>The detail and the cause are for the log and the stack trace. What reaches the caller is the
 * message the bundle defines for {@link #MESSAGE_KEY}, which names no technology and carries
 * nothing from either.
 *
 * <p>A failure the model does have an opinion about is a {@code DomainException} the module
 * declares, and the adapter throws that instead.
