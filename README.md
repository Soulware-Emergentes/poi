# Poi

A starting point for building a modular monolith with Spring Boot, structured around domain-driven design. Spring Modulith enforces the module boundaries, Flyway owns the schema, and Postgres is the only supported database.

Java 25, Spring Boot 4.1, Spring Modulith 2.1.

## Authentication

Every request carries an access token from staff, the identity provider, signed with a key staff publishes, naming `STAFF_ISSUER` as its issuer and carrying `POI_TOKEN_AUDIENCE` in its audience. A request without one is answered 401 with the usual error envelope.

| Token | Admitted on | Checked |
|---|---|---|
| A service's (`token_use: service`), such as sgt's | Endpoints under `/api/v1/tasks/` | `tasks.read` scope for reads, `tasks.write` for writes |
| A person's (`token_use: user`), from the `poi-web-dev` frontend | Every other endpoint, `/api/v1/tasks` itself included | The role the endpoint needs: `planner`, `analyst` or `admin` |

A token of the wrong kind for an endpoint, or without the scope or role it needs, is answered 403. The claims a person's subject and roles are read from are set in `poi.security.claims.*`, and the frontend's origin in `POI_WEB_ORIGIN`.

## Requirements

Docker has to be available for `./mvnw verify`. That half of the suite starts a throwaway Postgres container, so nothing needs to be installed or running beforehand, and it never touches a local database.

Running the application needs a local Postgres instance you provision yourself.

## Setting up a local database

The application uses two Postgres roles rather than one shared credential:

| Role | Privileges | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `poi_migrator` | Owns the schema, full DDL | Flyway, at startup |
| `poi_app` | `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` | The application, at runtime |

The runtime credential cannot create, alter, or drop tables. A leaked credential or an injection bug can tamper with data; it cannot destroy the schema.

[`scripts/db/setup-roles.sql`](scripts/db/setup-roles.sql) creates both roles and the database. It reads the passwords from the environment so they stay out of your shell history. Run it with:

```sh
export POI_MIGRATOR_PASSWORD='...'
export POI_APP_PASSWORD='...'
sudo -iu postgres psql -f scripts/db/setup-roles.sql
```

Then copy [`.env.example`](.env.example) to `.env` and fill in the same two passwords. `.env` is gitignored.

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

The database properties in `application.properties` have no fallback defaults. A missing `DB_URL` or `FLYWAY_URL` fails at startup rather than silently connecting somewhere unintended.

## Running

In VS Code, run the **Poi (Spring Boot)** configuration. It automatically reads `.env` through the `envFile` setting in [`.vscode/launch.json`](.vscode/launch.json).

From a shell, export the variables yourself first, since nothing loads `.env` implicitly:

```sh
set -a; source .env; set +a
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Both paths end up with the same variables resolved.

Flyway applies any pending migrations from `src/main/resources/db/migration` at startup, connecting as `poi_migrator`. Hibernate is set to `validate`, so the schema belongs to the migrations and entities are checked against it.

## Tests

In VS Code, use the Testing view or the gutter icons next to each test. From a shell:

```sh
./mvnw verify   # everything
./mvnw test     # only the tests that need no database
```

Classes named `*IT` need Docker and run under failsafe, in `verify`. Classes named `*Test` run under surefire, in `test`, and never touch a container.

The suite starts one Postgres container, runs `setup-roles.sql` inside it to create the roles, and shares that container across every test class. Flyway migrates the fresh database the first time a test boots the application context. The first run pulls the Postgres image.

Because the tests execute the real `setup-roles.sql`, breaking the privilege model there turns the build red.

[`DatabaseRoleSeparationIT`](src/test/java/lat/soulware/poi/platform/DatabaseRoleSeparationIT.java) connects with the application's own datasource and asserts that `poi_app` can write rows and cannot change the schema.

If you rename the roles or the database in `setup-roles.sql`, update the matching constants in [`PostgresIntegrationTest`](src/test/java/lat/soulware/poi/support/PostgresIntegrationTest.java) and the values in `.env.example`.

[`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs `test` on every push to any branch, and `verify` on pull requests and on pushes to `main` and `develop`.

[docs/ddd.md](docs/ddd.md) covers the two distinctions the model rests on (value objects against entities, entities against aggregate roots), why a repository serves only a root, how references cross boundaries, why cross-aggregate consistency is eventual, what a module publishes as its language and what publishing commits it to, and why reads answer a different question from writes.

[docs/packaging.md](docs/packaging.md) covers the package layout of a module, the criteria that decide where a type goes, what the published surface is, and the rules the build enforces to keep it that way.

[docs/shared-kernel.md](docs/shared-kernel.md) covers the base types every module builds on: the identity and model hierarchy, what each generic bound rejects, the persistence adapter base, and how to choose between the domain exceptions.

[docs/persistence.md](docs/persistence.md) covers the two-role privilege split and why the app never holds DDL rights, the separate paths reads and writes take, what opting into soft deletion commits you to, and what keeps a reference across an aggregate boundary truthful.

[docs/logging.md](docs/logging.md) covers the identifier every request is assigned, the three places it is published, and how a log line, an access log record, and a 5xx body are joined by it.

[docs/scaling.md](docs/scaling.md) covers when to introduce a load balancer and a connection pooler, and the prepared-statement tradeoff that comes with PgBouncer's transaction pooling.

[docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md) covers the test harness, what the platform tests assert, where tests live, how the build splits them by cost, and how CI runs them.
